Answer:
The Petr Petrov case centers around a serious car accident that took place on April 4, 2025. Petr   
Petrov, a 45-year-old software engineer, was commuting to work in his 2023 Honda Civic on Highway 2 
near Netanya when the incident occurred. At the time, the weather was challenging, characterized by 
moderate rain that led to significant water accumulation on the road and visibility reduced to less 
than 100 meters.

Despite being a cautious driver—reducing his speed to 80 km/h, which is below the posted limit of   
110 km/h, and maintaining a safe following distance—Mr. Petrov was involved in a collision due to   
the hazardous driving conditions. The case documentation outlines the timeline of the accident, the 
major injuries Mr. Petrov sustained, the subsequent medical procedures he underwent, and the        
insurance process related to the incident. The accident has had a profound impact on Mr. Petrov's   
life, as detailed in the case.
