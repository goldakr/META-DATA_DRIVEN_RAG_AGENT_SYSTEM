Answer:
The morning commute was marked by challenging weather conditions. A steady, moderate rain had been falling since 
the early hours, leading to significant accumulation of water on the roadway. Visibility was severely reduced, 
estimated to be less than 100 meters, due to the combination of active rainfall and spray from other vehicles.
