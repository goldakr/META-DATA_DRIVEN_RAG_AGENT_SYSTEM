      "actual_answer": "The largest payment to Petr Petrov was a final settlement payment of $212,500 made by the at-fault insurer, Amal Insurance Co., on July 10, 2025. This payment was the result of extensive negotiations following an initial offer that Petr's legal counsel deemed inadequate. The negotiations were driven by the severity of Petr's injuries, which included a permanent impairment from a fractured femur and ongoing effects from a traumatic brain injury, as well as significant emotional trauma and lost wages due to his inability to work as a software engineer. In addition to the final settlement, other payments related to Petr's car accident claim included a partial compensation of $50,000 received on June 15, 2025, a total loss payout of $30,000 for his 2023 Honda Civic on July 20, 2025, and reimbursements for medical payments and home modifications totaling $5,000 and $10,000, respectively. The comprehensive settlement agreement ultimately covered 85% of Petr's projected expenses and included provisions for substantial home modifications to address his long-term mobility challenges, such as the installation of ramps, widened doorways, and grab bars. The negotiations involved detailed discussions about medical reports, expert opinions on future care needs, and financial projections for lost income and rehabilitation costs, significantly improving upon the initial offer from the insurer.",

      "actual_answer": "Maria Petrov has been approved for a partial compensation of $50,000 as of June 15, 2025, following a vehicle collision that occurred on May 5, 2025. In this incident, she sustained minor injuries, including whiplash (neck strain), minor bruising on her left arm and shoulder, and a headache. Although she received treatment from paramedics at the scene, she declined transport to the hospital but was advised to seek further medical attention if her symptoms persisted. Maria reported minor medical expenses related to follow-up visits and potential physical therapy, as well as pain and suffering due to emotional distress and physical discomfort. The assessment concluded that the third party involved, John Smith, was solely responsible for the collision, having run a red light and struck Maria's vehicle, a 2023 Toyota Camry, which suffered significant damage primarily to the passenger side. Recommendations for claims adjustment include contacting John Smith's insurance provider, authorizing repairs for Maria's vehicle, and addressing her medical claims through her Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and the third-party's liability insurer.",
